    #   ftp.list('/some/path') do |e|

    #
    #     # Ignore everything that's not a file (so symlinks, directories and devices etc.)
    #     next unless entry.file?
    #
    #     # If entry isn't a kind_of Net::FTP::List::Unknown then there is a bug in Net::FTP::List if this isn't the
    #     # same name as ftp.nlist('/some/path') would have returned.

    # == Exceptions
    #
    # None at this time. At worst you'll end up with an Net::FTP::List::Unknown instance which won't have any extra
    # useful information. Methods like <tt>dir?</tt>, <tt>file?</tt> and <tt>symlink?</tt> will all return +false+.
